Hey Parker! For the technical assessment I'll be sending you a link to starter code on Github and I want you to build out:
GET '/projects' which should return a json response with all the projects that are in the database along with the appropriate status code. Do not worry about serialization.
POST '/projects' which should create a new project with the json in the request and send back the new project in the response body with the appropriate status code. Do not worry about serialization.

You have until the EOD today to send a video recording of you building out the two deliverables and talking through what you are doing. Please do not use notes. You can google as long as that is in the video recording.

You can record in a zoom breakout room or use another tool (loom is a popular one) to record. You can send the video file directly to me on discord or upload the video and share the link.
